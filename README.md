# Github Activity Summaries

You can get a summary of repository activity e-mailed by adding the `activity_summary_to` field to your repository's `ietf.json` file.

See [this example](https://www.w3.org/mid/20191006004517.42CACC2B6B@cloud.mnot.net) and the [IETF Repository Data Service](https://github.com/ietf-github-services/repo-data#ietf-repository-data-service) for more information.

Activity summaries will be e-mailed weekly, and only one e-mail will be sent to each recipient, summarising all of the repositories they are watching.
